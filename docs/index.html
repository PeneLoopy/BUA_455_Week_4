## BUA 455 - Week 4

### Combining Skills and Quiz Review

&lt;br&gt;


#### Penelope Pooler Eisenbies

#### "2023-02-09"

[Wikipedia Sloth Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloth)

---

### Reminders:

#### HW 3 Due 2/8

**There is a 2 day grace period on this assignment.**

#### Textbook

- A list of text sections can be found **[here](https://docs.Google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yhUSJAJQ4VVjVBpiv3_C2D3tQs2SmJjynSq9chqXOwc/edit?usp=sharing)** and will be updated as the course progresses.

### Quiz 1 on Thursday 2/16

- Weeks 1 - 4 (Lectures 1 - 8)
  
  - There will be a little new material this week, but we will mostly be discussing
  
     - a review of the skills covered so far
  
     - different ways to combine these skills
     
     - how to know what to do for a given data management situation
     
- HW 1 - 3

---

### Side Trip for a Great Question

###   **`%&gt;%`**     vs.     **`|&gt;`**

- What's the difference?

- For your purposes they are interchangeable, but |&gt; is newer 

- `%&gt;%` requires `magrittr` package but `|&gt;` doesn't 

   - I load it anyways as a precaution in case I need other pipe functions
   
- `|&gt;` may give you an error if are working on a machine with an old version of R or RStudio

- `|&gt;` is slightly more efficient because of what the computer is doing is slightly different

- [More information for those who are interested (not required)](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/05/the-new-r-pipe/)

### Import and Data Preparation 


```r
mojo_22_fall_wknd &lt;- read_csv("Box_Office_Mojo_Week3_HW3.csv", show_col_types=F) |&gt;   # import data
  mutate(Month = factor(month,                                                        # create factors
                         levels=c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun",
                                  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")),
         Day = factor(day,     
                         levels=c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"),
                         labels= c("M", "T", "W", "Th", "F", "Sa", "Su"))) |&gt;
  select(Month, Day, top10gross) |&gt;                                                  # select variables
  group_by(Month, Day) |&gt;                                                            # group by category
  summarize(max_top10g = max(top10gross, na.rm=T)) |&gt;                                # summarize
  ungroup() |&gt;                                                                       # ungroup
  filter(Day %in% c("F", "Sa", "Su") &amp; Month %in% c("Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"))     # filter fall wknds
```

### What we will do with **`mojo_22_fall_wknd`**

**`5.`** In the second chunk after these instructions, modify code to:

   i. Use `mutate` to convert values to millions (divide by 1000000) and round to 4 decimal places.

   ii. Use `pivot_wider` to reshape data to Wide format with one column for month and one column for each day of week.

   iii. Round reshaped data to two decimal places (demo of how to multiple columns at once).

   iv. Export reshaped data with rounded values (2 decimal places) to a .csv file to be submitted.

   v. Write a separate statement to pipe this table to a `kable()` command to practice that skill.
   
&lt;br&gt;
**`6.`** Submit the .csv file with your name in the **Week 4 In-class Exercise** in the **LECTURES** section on Blackboard

**NOTES:** 

- This counts as part of your **in-class participation** for Lecture 6 and is due by Wednesday, 2/8 at midnight.

- No late work is accepted for in-class exercises but this does not count towards your HW grade.

- We will do more in-class exercises throughout the semester.

---

### In-class Excerise Code will be done together


```r
mojo_22_fall_wknd_wide &lt;- mojo_22_fall_wknd




#write_csv()
```



---

class: middle

### Week 4 In-class Exercises (L7 - Q2)

***NOT ON PointSolutions***

If all the columns in a dataset are numeric, you can round the whole dataset at once with the command `round(&lt;name of dataset&gt;)`.

Why wouldn't that work for the dataset in the previous exercise, `mojo_22_fall_wknd_wide`?

&lt;br&gt;

Hint: To answer this question, you are encouraged to 

- try running the command `round(mojo_22_fall_wknd_wide)` 

- examine the data using `glimpse`

### Practice Question 1 (abridged)

Examine the my_mtcars dataset using **`glimpse`**.

**`1.`** How many rows are in the original my_mtcars dataset?


**`2.`** `mtcars` is an older dataset so although there are many kinds of variables they are all coded as one type of variable for simplicity.

All of the variables in the **`my_mtcars`** dataset are type `____`?
 
Save a new version of `my_mtcars` to a new name such as `my_mtcars1` and filter the new dataset to:

only include cars with BOTH a straight engine (variable is `vs`) and an automatic transmission (variable is `am`).

Examine the new filtered data set in the Global Environment or using `glimpse`.

**`3.`** How many rows are in this new filtered dataset you created?
 

Click on this new filtered dataset in the Global Environment to answer this question. Round your answer to a whole number.

**`4.`** Within the new filtered dataset, the highest mpg (miles per gallon) is `____`.

### Practice Question (Question 2)

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[**Instructions**]

- Use square brackets to select **rows 6 through 25** and **columns 1, 2, and 6** of the my_mtcars data set and save this smaller dataset as a new data set with a different name, e.g. **`my_mtcars2`**.


- Examine the new dataset using glimpse.

- Create a factor variable, **`cylF`**, from **`cyl`** in this dataset. No levels or labels are needed.

- The variables in your new dataset should be **`wt`**, **`mpg`**, **`cyl`**, and **`cylF`**

- You can examine the definitions of these variables by examining the dataset help file:

1. In the console, type ?mtcars
2. Examine the dataset documentation in the help window in the lower right panel of RStudio.

- Create and save a scatter plot with **`x = wt`**, **`y = mpg`**, and **`color = cylF`**.

**Explore:** How would plot look if **`cyl`** was used instead of **`cylF`**

Click on the dataset in the Global Environment to answer questions 1 and 2

Hint: Once the dataset is opened, remember that you can click on a column to sort the dataset by a specific variable.
