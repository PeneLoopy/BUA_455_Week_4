### Reminders:

#### HW 3 Due 9/21

**There is a 2 day grace period on this assignment.**

#### Textbook

- A list of text sections can be found **[here](https://docs.Google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yhUSJAJQ4VVjVBpiv3_C2D3tQs2SmJjynSq9chqXOwc/edit?usp=sharing)** and will be updated as the course progresses.

### Quiz 1 on Tuesday 9/27

- Weeks 1 - 4 (Lectures 1 - 8)
  
  - There will be a little new material this week, but we will mostly be discussing
  
     - a review of the skills covered so far
  
     - different ways to combine these skills
     
     - how to know what to do for a given data management situation
     
- HW 1 - 3

---

### Detour and Preview

.pull-left[

**How to talk about your skillset**

At the end of this course, I cover some related topics.

One key topic for students: 
- How do we explain our skills?

It can be more difficult than you expect.

<br>

**Good News:**

'Data Camp' has published a [White Paper about Data Fluency](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_VoM3D6tPftjZpXCnTL8SKYBlOM_4KjG/view?usp=sharing).

It includes a great summary of skills and how they translate into roles in a working environment.

You do not have to read all 17 pages and you **DEFINITELY** will not be tested on this.

  - logical (*`lgl`*)
  
  - factor(*`<fct>`*, *`<ord>`*)
     - Recall that in Week 3 we discussed how to convert character variables to factors
     
     - Numeric variables can also be converted to factors
     
---
  
### Week 2

- Review of Week 1 

- `dplyr` package commands to select, modify, and summarize data:
  
  - `select` - used to select variables
  
  - `filter` - used to filter observation by observation values
  
     - Can be used with 
        
       - numeric values
       
       - character values
       
       - factor levels
  
  - `slice`  - used to filter or select observations by location
  
  - `mutate` - used to modify variables or create new variables
  
  - `factor` - used to create a factor variable from another variable
  
---

### Week 3

- Review of Weeks 1 and 2 
  
- Coercion commands to coerce a variable to the type needed
    - `as.integer`, `as.numeric`, `as.character`

### Format of Quiz 1

- Students will have 70 minutes

- Students with an accomdation we will schedule an alternative.

- All students must work alone.

- Quiz intended to be long and many students may not finish.
  
  - All questions are equally weighted and independent.
  
  - Do the best you can.
  
- There will be approximately 6-7 multipart questions on Blackboard.

  - Each question will have multiple versions.
  
  - The questions will include instructions and may include some partial R code
  
  - For each question you will:
  
        - copy and paste provided R code into provided Quiz 1 template in provided Quiz 1 R project
        - Complete the R code in the Quiz 1 template
        - Answer the question on Blackboard
  
---

### Grading of Quiz 1 

- Because there are 60 students, grading will take a little time.

- TAs and I will complete grading together.

- For each question, R code (60%) and Blackboard answers (40%) will count towards final grade.

- Quiz 1 is worth 22.5% of your final grade in this course.


### Practice Questions for Quiz 1

- There are a set of 11 practice questions posted on Blackboard.

- Your Quiz 1 questions will be similar to these and will use these same datasets or similar ones.

- If other data are used:
  - I will post an announcement, so you can examine the data and documentation before the quiz.
  
---

### Before Thursday

- Download and save the Practice Questions

- Look over Blackboard Questions
  - Take notes on what is not clear for you.
  - I will answer questions on Thursday.

- I will post video solution for Practice Questions on Thursday

### Before Quiz 1:

- Work through all the practice questions and write the code with comments to make sure you understand it.

- Quiz 1 is open notes so you can use the code you create for the Practice Questions.
  
- Make sure that your laptop has up-to-date versions of R and RStudio
  
- All packages listed in the setup for Quiz 1 are successfully installed and loaded in R on your laptop.

### All Datasets in Quiz 1 Practice Questions

```{r save datasets to global environment}

# save R datasets for Quiz 1 to Global Environment
my_mtcars <- mtcars
my_diamonds <- diamonds
my_starwars <- starwars
my_orange <- Orange |> glimpse()

# import these two summary datasets 
# mn_numreleases is the mean number of releases in movie_smry_w1
movie_smry_w1 <- read_csv("Movie_Summary_Wide_1.csv", 
                          show_col_types = F)
# mn_top10gross is the mean gross of the top 10 movies in movie_smry_w2
movie_smry_w2 <- read_csv("Movie_Summary_Wide_2.csv", 
                          show_col_types = F)

```

### Example Practice Question (Question 2)

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[**Instructions**]

- Use square brackets to select **rows 6 through 25** and **columns 1, 2, and 6** of the my_mtcars data set and save this smaller dataset as a new data set with a different name, e.g. **`my_mtcars2`**.


- Examine the new dataset using glimpse.

- Create a factor variable, cylF, in this dataset. No levels or labels are needed.

- The variables in your new dataset should be **`wt`**, **`mpg`**, **`cyl`**, and **`cylF`**

- You can examine the definitions of these variables by examining the dataset help file:

1. In the console, type ?mtcars
2. Examine the dataset documentation in the help window in the lower right panel of RStudio.

- Create and save a scatter plot with **`x = wt`**, **`y = mpg`**, and **`color = cylF`**.

**Explore: How would plot look if cyl was used instead of cylF**

Click on the dataset in the Global Environment to answer questions 1 and 2

Hint: Once the dataset is opened, remember that you can click on a column to sort the dataset by a specific variable.
