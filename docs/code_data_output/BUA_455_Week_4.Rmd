### Reminders:

#### HW 3 Due 2/7

**There is a 2 day grace period on this assignment.**

- Practice Questions from Spring of 2023 are Posted.

- I will talk more about the test on Thursday

- On Tuesday, I will hold an optional Q&A Zoom at 7:00 PM

  - Come with questions because I will not prepare material.


### Quiz 1 on Thursday 2/15

- Weeks 1 - 4 (Lectures 1 - 8)
  
- HW 1 - 3

---

### Side Trip about piping

###   **`%>%`**     vs.     **`|>`**

- What's the difference?

- For your purposes they are interchangeable, but |> is newer 

- `%>%` requires `magrittr` package but `|>` doesn't 

   - I load it anyways as a precaution in case I need other pipe functions
   
- `|>` may give you an error if are working on a machine with an old version of R or RStudio

- `|>` is slightly more efficient because of what the computer is doing is slightly different

- [More information for those who are interested (not required)](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/05/the-new-r-pipe/)

### Completed code from Week 3 Exercise

Alternative to option below:

- Round data as desired in mutate statement before reshaping data with `pivot_wider`.

```{r  completed code from Week 3}


mojo_22_fall_wknd_wide <- mojo_22_fall_wknd |>
  mutate(max_top10g = (max_top10g/1000000) |> round(4)) |>                # convert to millions
  pivot_wider(id_cols=Month, names_from = Day, values_from = max_top10g)  # reshape data

mojo_22_fall_wknd_wide[,2:4] <- round(mojo_22_fall_wknd_wide[,2:4],1)     # round cols 2-4 to one decimal

# mojo_22_fall_wknd_wide[,2:4] <- round(mojo_22_fall_wknd_wide[,2:4])     # round cols 2-4 to whole numbers

mojo_22_fall_wknd_wide |> write_csv("Week_4_In_Class_First_Name_Last_Name.csv") # export as .csv 

mojo_22_fall_wknd_wide |> kable()       # create kable table (was not required in Week 3)


```

### Week 4 In-class Exercises (L7 - Q2)

***NOT ON PointSolutions***

If all the columns in a dataset are numeric, you can round the whole dataset at once with the command `round(<name of dataset>)`.

Why wouldn't that work for the dataset in the previous exercise, `mojo_22_fall_wknd_wide`?

<br>

Hint: To answer this question, you are encouraged to 

- try running the command `round(mojo_22_fall_wknd_wide)` 

- examine the data using `glimpse`

---

### All Datasets in Quiz 1 Practice Questions

```{r save datasets to global environment}

# save R datasets for Quiz 1 to Global Environment
my_mtcars <- mtcars
my_diamonds <- diamonds
my_starwars <- starwars
my_orange <- Orange

# import these two summary datasets 
# mn_numreleases is the mean number of releases in movie_smry_w1
movie_smry_w1 <- read_csv("Movie_Summary_Wide_1.csv", 
                          show_col_types = F)
# mn_top10gross is the mean gross of the top 10 movies in movie_smry_w2
movie_smry_w2 <- read_csv("Movie_Summary_Wide_2.csv", 
                          show_col_types = F)

# mojo1999 is the full year of movie data from 1999
mojo1999 <- read_csv("Box_Office_Mojo_1999.csv", show_col_types = F)

```

---

<br>
  
***Questions are designed to be short, but Quiz questions will be a little shorter.***

---

### Practice Question 1 (abridged)

Examine the my_mtcars dataset using **`glimpse`**.

**`1.`** How many rows are in the original my_mtcars dataset?


**`2.`** `mtcars` is an older dataset so although there are many kinds of variables they are all coded as one type of variable for simplicity.

All of the variables in the **`my_mtcars`** dataset are type `____`?
 
Save a new version of `my_mtcars` to a new name such as `my_mtcars1` and filter the new dataset to:

only include cars with BOTH a straight engine (variable is `vs`) and an automatic transmission (variable is `am`).

Examine the new filtered data set in the Global Environment or using `glimpse`.


**`3.`** How many rows are in this new filtered dataset you created?
 

Click on this new filtered dataset in the Global Environment to answer this question. Round your answer to a whole number.

**`4.`** Within the new filtered dataset, the highest mpg (miles per gallon) is `____`.

---

### Plan for Thursday

- I will post a video for each Practice Question

- You should 

  - Finish HW 3
  
  - Read through these questions.
  
    - Take notes of questions you don't understand
    
    - Clarifications requested will make Quiz 1 more clear.
    
    - Practice Questions have typos. 
      - **Please let me know.**
    
### Time for Questions

- Questions about Practice Questions and Quiz 1

- Individual Questions about HW 3


---

### Practice Question (Question 2)

- Use square brackets to select **rows 6 through 25** and **columns 1, 2, and 6** of the my_mtcars data set and save this smaller dataset as a new data set with a different name, e.g. **`my_mtcars2`**.


- Examine the new dataset using glimpse.

- The variables in your new dataset should be **`wt`**, **`mpg`**, and **`cyl`**. 

- You can examine the definitions of these variables by examining the dataset help file:

1. In the console, type ?mtcars
2. Examine the dataset documentation in the help window in the lower right panel of RStudio.

- Create and save a scatter plot with **`x = wt`**, **`y = mpg`**, and **`color = factor(cyl)`**.

**Note that color = factor(cyl) is used because cylinder is an ordinal categorical variable and we want the plot to show that.**

Click on the dataset in the Global Environment to answer questions 1 and 2

Hint: Once the dataset is opened, remember that you can click on a column to sort the dataset by a specific variable.


```{r Q2}
my_mtcars2 <- my_mtcars[6:25, c(1,2,6)] |>
  glimpse(width = 40)

(mtcars_scatter <- my_mtcars2 |>    
   ggplot() +
   geom_point(aes(x=wt, y=mpg, color=factor(cyl))))

```

**`Q1`** How many categories are in the cyl (cylinder) variable in the dataset you created?

<br>

**`Q2`** The lowest mpg in your new dataset is

<br>

**`Q3`** Based on the plot, specify whether the correlation between each pair of variables is positive (1) or negative (2).

Enter the number of the correct choice.

- There is a `____` correlation between `wt` and `mpg`.

- There is a `____` correlation between `cyl` and `mpg`.

- There is a `____` correlation between `wt` and `cyl`.
